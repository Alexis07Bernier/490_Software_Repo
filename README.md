This project, commissioned by the McGill Ice Hockey Research Group (IHRG), focuses on the design and development of a hockey puck embedded with advanced sensors to calculate peak velocity during gameplay. By integrating advanced technology into a standard hockey puck, we aim to enhance performance analysis for players and coaches. The testing phase encompasses both on-ice and off-ice scenarios, allowing for comprehensive data collection under varying conditions. Additionally, simulation techniques will be employed to validate sensor performance and data accuracy. To facilitate user interaction and data management, a high-level user interface will be developed, enabling users to easily record, analyze, and visualize performance metrics. This innovative approach aims to contribute to the ongoing advancement of sports technology research in hockey.
